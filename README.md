### Description ###
*This Homebrew could help you delete the game trophies you won't like to synch.*

## IMPORTANT ##
**Everytime a trophy Is deleted/modified, the trophy app/bubble  must be launched to update the trophy db, we highly recommend you to disable the wifi in the PS Vita before launching the trophy app/bubble for this matter.**

**This app doesn't use the system call to unlock the trophies, it directly modify the trophy files.**
**We highly recommend you to backup your trophies files before modify and check the modify result in trophy app/bubble offline to prevent loss**

**If your trophy disappear after modify, try L1+Triangle in Trophy Manager title screen to rebuild the trophy database. If that fail then you should maybe restore your backup. Provide the corrupted files to see if we can help locate the bug**
